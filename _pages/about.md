I'm a Ph.D. candidate in sociology at the [University of Minnesota](https://cla.umn.edu/sociology). I am also an alumni predoctoral trainee at the [Minnesota Population Center](https://pop.umn.edu/), holding a Ph.D. minor degree in Population Studies. My research interests are broadly in the areas of social stratification and mobility, sociology of work, life course studies, social psychology, and medical sociology. 

In my dissertation, I study the life course cumulative patterns and health consequences of agentic rewards from work, i.e., the highly-valued non-monetary aspects of a job that are central to the empowerment and agentic development of individual workers, such as autonomy and control at work, the sense of accomplishment, and opportunities for advancement. 

Before starting my Ph.D. study in the United States, I graduated with a master's degree in American Studies from Beijing Foreign Studies University and a bachelor's degree in English Language and Literature from Xi'an Jiaotong University in China.



How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
