I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Sociology at the [University of Minnesota](https://cla.umn.edu/sociology). I am also an alumni predoctoral trainee at the [Minnesota Population Center](https://pop.umn.edu/), holding a Ph.D. minor in Population Studies. My research interests are broadly in the areas of social stratification and mobility, sociology of work, life course studies, social psychology, and medical sociology. 

In my dissertation, I study the life course stratification of non-economic intrinsic job rewards and their associations with economic mobility and health disparities over the life course. Specifically, intrinsic job rewards are defined as those highly-valued non-monetary rewards derived from completing the work tasks themselves as opposed to extrinsic rewards that are external to the experience of working, including autonomy and control at work, a sense of purpose and accomplishment, interesting and engaging work, opportunities for developing skills, etc. 

I have also published broadly on the life course influences of labor market experiences on health, such as the later life health implications of cumulative unionization, and the impacts of perceived discrimination at work on depressed mood. My research has appeared in the *Journal of Health and Social Behavior*, *Longitudinal and Life Course Studies*, and the *Chinese Journal of Sociology*.
