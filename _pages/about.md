I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Sociology and M.S. Candidate in Biostatistics at the [University of Minnesota](https://cla.umn.edu/sociology). I am also an alumni predoctoral trainee at the [Minnesota Population Center](https://pop.umn.edu/), holding a Ph.D. minor in Population Studies. My research interests are broadly in the areas of life course studies, social stratification and mobility, sociology of work, social psychology, medical sociology, and quantitative methods. 

In my dissertation, I study the life course stratification of non-economic intrinsic job rewards, as an additional dimension of labor market inequality beyond pay, and their associations with economic mobility and health disparities over the life course. Specifically, intrinsic job rewards are highly-valued non-monetary rewards derived from completing the work tasks themselves, such as autonomy and control at work, a sense of purpose and accomplishment, interesting and meaningful work, opportunities for developing skills, etc. 

I have published broadly on the life course influences of labor market experiences on health, such as the later life health implications of cumulative unionization, and the impacts of perceived discrimination at work on depressed mood. My research has appeared in the *Journal of Health and Social Behavior*, *Longitudinal and Life Course Studies*, and *Chinese Journal of Sociology*.
